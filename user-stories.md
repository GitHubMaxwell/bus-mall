## User Stories

#User stories for the marketing team

1. need to build code that allows the marketing team to see data in the form of a graph (chart.js) what pictures were shown and what was clicked on.
2. adding to that functionality, i need to allow the team to see what was clicked
3. the ratio that something was shown versus how much it was clicked. keep track off how many times it

#User stories for the client

1. build the app to display three different images at a time
2. they need to click an image, have that action stored, and display the next three images
3. after 25 clicks the program should stop and results shown

#User Story for Design team

1. make the app subtly attractive in terms of nice font and a simple color palette (so as not to distract or wrongly influence the user interaction)
